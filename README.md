# IF_Zone
A hub for keeping track of my favorite Interactive Fiction works, plus some original work too.

## What is IF and Handy Resources
* Interactive Fiction ([IF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)) is a genre of books and text-based games; think choose-your-own-adventure stories with increased player input
* [IFDB](https://ifdb.tads.org/): where IF authors post their games free to play
* [Gargoyle](http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/): software that runs IF games files that do not have an in-brower play option
* [Borogove](https://borogove.app/): in-brower Inform editor

## Favorite IFs!
